# cazabe
Cazabe is a free vector animation IDE.

It was a FLOSS replacement for Adobe/Macromedia Flash written in Qt/C++.

The .cz format was created to save flash projects done with Cazabe. The cz2swf tool (see https://github.com/0xdac/cz2swf) outputs a .swf movie from a .cz file.

The project is dead since 2011. If you or your organization are interested or have questions feel free to contact me at darien@0xdac.org.
